The goal of this project was to re-implement and evaluate the performance of two Reinforcement Learning algorithms, DQN (Deep Q-Network) and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient). The algorithms were re-implemented based on their original research papers, and their efficiency was compared across similar tasks. DQN was tested on problems with discrete action spaces, while DDPG was applied to tasks with continuous action spaces.
