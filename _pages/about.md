Hello! My name is Thomas, and I am an enthusiastic AI student with a passion for exploring the endless possibilities of artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in machine learning, deep learning, and especially applications to Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models.

Through my studies, I have gained experience in programming, algorithm design, and working with a variety of AI tools and frameworks. I am always eager to learn about new developments in the field of AI and expand my knowledge.
